# omega-edit-aarch

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is no longer maintained now that GitHub provides ARM/AARCH runners. Please see [ctc-oss/omega-edit](https://github.com/ctc-oss/omega-edit) instead.

This repository is used to hold two `omega-edit-native` JAR files to add support for Apple Silicon Macs and Linux arm machines. One JAR is for Apple Silicon and one is for Linux so that both Apple Silicon, Apple Silicon Linux vms and arm Linux should work.

This to help update `omega-edit` to be able to fully function with Apple Silicon Mac's and arm machines.
